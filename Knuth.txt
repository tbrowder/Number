Unfortunately, to handle all bases from 2 to 91, we have to use the
method of "mixed bases" (A .. B) shown as the answer to Exercise 10 of
Section 4.1 on page 605.

The problem is that set A conversions are for bases which are powers
of base 2. That method is shown as Equation (5) on page 204. Set B
conversions are for bases NOT in set A.

Set (A .. B) conversions are
