Possible future features
========================

handle real numbers (i.e., signed and fractional)

improve signature forms, names, return types, etc.

improve docs
  + signature descriptions

allow addition and subtraction between two numbers with different bases (as
  long as no negative number will result)
  (note that Raku already allows that between decimal, octal, binary,
  and hexadecimal numbers)

DONE: handle bases 37 through 62 (and possibly variants, see Wikipedia)

add named param to add 'base-X' to a transformed number (position?)

DONE: add bases higher than 62 with named digit sets

allow user-defined digit sets

add a Number class with defined operators +, -, div, mod, /, %, **, *

DONE: redo base91 alphabet to put decimal (radix) point char in last place
  in order to allow fractional representation for bases 2-90
