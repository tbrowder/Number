Possible future features
========================

handle real numbers (i.e., signed and fractional)

replace complex handling with simple one where possible
  see TODO in lib/Number/Rebase.rakumod, ~ line 565
  see TODO in t/3-general-base-transforms.t

improve signature forms, names, return types, etc.

improve docs
  + signature descriptions

allow addition and subtraction between two numbers with different bases (as
  long as no negative number will result)
  (note that Raku already allows that between decimal, octal, binary,
  and hexadecimal numbers)

add named param to add 'base-X' to a transformed number (position?)

allow user-defined digit sets

add a Number class with
   to/from base
   multiply-by
   divide-by
   defined operators +, -, div, mod, /, %, **, *

DONE: redo base91 alphabet to put decimal (radix) point char in last place
  in order to allow fractional representation for bases 2-90

DONE: handle bases 37 through 62 (and possibly variants, see Wikipedia)

DONE: add bases higher than 62 with named digit sets
